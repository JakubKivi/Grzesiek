# Grzesiek
Second version of my first arduino robot


Grzesiek is my first project. With him by my side, I have fallen in love with robotics, electronics, and programming. There were actually 2 versons of the robot. First one I have made in 2017 for the ending of my middle school (I have this on my diploma). There is nothing to boast about, becouse I was 16 and code is a crap for me now. But videos are cute and memorable. Second version of Grzesiek was abandoned (stripped and cased), but I hope that one day I will have enought time for him.
